### Configure GitHub build & deploy automation

This repository contains a Github Workflow which automates the building and deploying of the HTML game to GitHub Pages.

This workflow can be found in `.github/workflows/html_build.yml` and in the Actions tab on GitHub.

This workflow will require a secret access token in order to deploy your game to GitHub pages.

#### Steps to add the secret access token:

- Go to your account settings on GitHub
- Go to 'Developer settings' -> 'Personal access tokens'
- Click 'Generate new token'
- Create a token with the 'repo' scope
- Copy the access token
- Go to 'Secrets' in your repository's settings
- Add a new secret with the name 'ACCESS_TOKEN' and paste the token in the text field
- Trigger the workflow (by commiting something for example) and the game should appear on `https://*your-username*.github.io/*your-repo-name*/game.html`
